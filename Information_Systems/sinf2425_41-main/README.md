# SINF Template Repository

This repository serves as a sample for Information Systems (SINF), demonstrating how to utilize GitLab for managing your SINF project and providing a foundational starting point for development.

## Introduction

In this project, you will work with **Dinasore**, **PostgreSQL**, **Grafana**, and **4DIAC-IDE**. The Dynamic INtelligent Architecture for Software and MOdular REconfiguration (**Dinasore**) is a distributed platform that facilitates the configuration and development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). **Dinasore** supports the implementation of Function Block (FB) based pipelines for sensor integration, data processing, and systems control. These FBs are developed in Python. **Dinasore** employs the **4DIAC-IDE** as its graphical user interface (GUI). Sensor data is produced via **Dinasore** and stored in a relational database (**PostgreSQL**). Finally, **Grafana** connects to **PostgreSQL**, enabling the visualization of this data through the creation of dashboards.

If you are utilizing this repository as a starting point, thereâ€™s no need to worry about the implementation of PostgreSQL, Grafana, and Dinasore, as they will be virtualized using Docker. You only need to have Docker installed and the 4DIAC-IDE downloaded from our provided sources. For more details on preparing the development environment, please refer to the [Documentation](#documentation) section.
