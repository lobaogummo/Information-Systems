	<p id="topOfPage">Using QX, IX and similar allows you to access the
		inputs and outputs of a supported hardware. Of course, in the case of
		a normal computer, this doesn't apply since it doesn't have I/O that
		you can control directly like you do on a PLC (normally boolean). In
		order to access the I/O of a hardware, you need to set the PARAMS data
		input to a corresponding value to select which I/O to access. 4diac&nbsp;FORTE
		should be compiled with the corresponding module, that can be selected
		in CMake. You find here the values to be set to PARAMS for the
		following supported platforms:</p>

		The following picture shows an example application from the <a
			href="../../html/4diacIDE/use4diacLocally.html">Blinking tutorial</a> which
		is extended with IX and QX function blocks. The extended application
		periodically toggles on pin number 8. It can be started and stopped
		via pin number 2. You can connect an LED to obtain a blinking light.
	</p>

	<img src="../../html/parameters/img/ixqx_fb_network.png"
		alt="Simple blinking application with an IX and QX function block." />

	<p>
		The <span class="specificText">PARAMS</span> data input in the IX and
		QX FB define which pin should be used. The application also contains
		E_CYCLE and E_SWITCH function blocks (which are not in the Blinking
		tutorial). The first one generates an event every 500 ms. This way the
		IX block will check the hardware input every half second if the signal
		has changed. E_SWITCH_0 starts or stops the action, depending on the <span
			class="specificText">IN</span> data output of the IX function block.

	<h1 id="umic">&micro;MIC.200</h1>

	<p>
		This module uses the library provided for the <a
			href="http://www.microcontrol.net/en/products/control-systems/umic200/"
			target="_blank">&micro;MIC.200</a>. 
			You need the <span class="fileLocation">umic_dio.h</span>,
		<span class="fileLocation">umic_relay.h</span> and <span
			class="fileLocation">umic_led.h</span> headers and also the <span
			class="fileLocation">umic.so</span> library to be present in your
		system and accessible by the compiler.
	</p>

	<p>The parameters should be the type and its number separated by a
		dot:</p>
	<p>
		<span class="specificText">TYPE.NUMBER</span>
	</p>

	<p>NUMBER depends on TYPE, where TYPE can be (all are in
		lowercase):</p>
	<ol>
		<li><span class="inlineTitle">led</span>: controls the LED1-4 of
			the &micro;MIC.200 (Only QX can be used with <span class="specificText">led</span>).
			The possible numbers for NUMBER are from 0 to 7 according to the
			table below:
			<p></p>
			<ul>
				<li>0 &rarr; LED1_GREEN<br></li>
				<li>1 &rarr; LED2_GREEN<br></li>
				<li>2 &rarr; LED3_GREEN<br></li>

				Example:<br> dio.3 &rarr; will access Digital I/O 3 at pin 7 of
				the &micro;MIC.200
			</p></li>
		<li><span class="inlineTitle">relay</span>: controls the relays.
			The possible numbers are 1 and 2. The 1 controls the NO relay and 2
			the NC. Only QX can be used with <span class="specificText">relay</span>.<br>
			<p>
				Example:<br> relay.1 &rarr; will control the NC relay at pins
				14- 15</li>
	</ol>

		alt="FBs example for uMIC platform">

	<p class="attention">
		<span class="inlineTitle">Attention</span>: To use the relay and led,
		in some cases you might have to change some header files in your
		&micro;MIC.200. You need to find the files <span class="fileLocation">/usr/include/umic_led.h</span>
		and <span class="fileLocation">/usr/include/umic_relay.h</span> and
		add two things:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>At the beginning, right after the first #define add:
			<div class="code">//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
				// take precautions if compiled with C++ compiler #ifdef __cplusplus
				extern "C" { #endif
				//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//</div>
		</li>
		<li>And at the end, right before the last #endif, add
			<div class="code">//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
				#ifdef __cplusplus } #endif // end of C++ compiler wrapper

	<h1 id="mlpi">Bosch Rexroth PLC (MLPI)</h1>

	<p>
		The MLPI interface was tested on a <a
			href="http://www.boschrexroth.com/dcc/Vornavigation/VorNavi.cfm?PageID=p650746&Language=en"
			target="_blank">IndraControl XM22</a> PLC from Bosch Rexroth. In
		order for 4diac&nbsp;FORTE to access the I/O, a PLC program must be running
		already in the PLC. 4diac&nbsp;FORTE will connect to this program and
		send/receive information to/from it.
	</p>

	<p>The parameters that you need to use in PARAMS depend therefore
		from the names you gave to the I/Os in the PLC program. That means
		that you need to create your program and give them names. An example
		was tested where the Digital Inputs were called di01, di01, di02 and
		so on, and similarly with Digital Outputs (do00, do01, do02, etc). To
		access them from 4diac&nbsp;FORTE, the parameters were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Application.UserVarGlobal.di00 &rarr; Digital Input 00</li>
		<li>Application.UserVarGlobal.di01 &rarr; Digital Input 01</li>
		<li>Application.UserVarGlobal.do00 &rarr; Digital Output 00</li>

	<h1 id="ev3">Lego Mindstorms EV3</h1>

	<p>
		This section is a reference of the parameters that can be used in
		4diac&nbsp;FORTE to access the I/O of the LMSEV3. Reading this section carefully
		without using them could be quite boring and even useless,because the
		details will be forgotten if not used. We recommend to give a quick
		reading in order to know what can be accessed using 4diac&nbsp;FORTE. The <a
			href="../../html/examples/pidMotor.html">example</a> presents the
		control of a motor using a PID controller.
	</p>

<!--***************-->

	<h2 id="ev3_standard_parameters">Standard Access</h2>
<!--**********-->
	<h3>Transparent Access</h3>

	<p>The standard access refers to the access through well defined I/O
		blocks, that allow transparency in the access of I/O in different
		platforms. Each block supports different parameters in the PARAM
		input, which defines the I/O of the system that will be accessed. The
		blocks used to control the I/O are named with two capital letters.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>The first letter indicates the direction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Q: output</li>
				<li>I: input</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The second letter indicates the size of it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>X: boolean</li>
				<li>W: Word (16 bits)</li>
				<li>D: Double (32 bits)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>So, for example a boolean input is read using the functional
		block IX. The output word, for example the PWM value of a motor is
		controlled with a QW block. Not all sizes are implemented in all
		platforms.</p>
<!--**********-->
	<h3>Parameters for the Lego Mindstorms EV3</h3>

	<p>The parameters for the Lego Mindstorms EV3 were designed for general use, and
		extension of them is easy to achieve. The format of the parameters
		follow 2 important rules:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>The only capital letters allowed are the A,B,C,D when used to
				define the output ports of the EV3 (outA, outB, outC, outD).</p>
		</li>

		<li><p>The parameters are given in three parts separated by
				points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>port.typeOfIO.specific</p></li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li><p>port</p>
					<p>The first part of the parameter specifies the port of the
						Input or Output. For the EV3, the possible values are [in1 | in2 |
						in3 | in4 | outA | outB | outC | outD | emb]. The first eight are
						directly related to the actual ports of the EV3. The 'emb' port
						refers to anything that can be managed in the EV3 but not in the
						I/O ports, until now the leds and buttons, but in the future the
						screen and speaker would also be reference with the 'emb' port.</p></li>
				<li><p>typeOfIO</p>
					<p>The second part, specifies what is actually connected to the
						specified port. The possible values are [sensor | sensorw | button
						| led | motor]. The difference between 'sensor' and 'sensorw' is
						that 'sensor' is used for boolean sensors, and 'sensorw' for
						sensors which values are words (16 bits). The 'led' and 'button'
						are used to control the embedded leds and buttons of the EV3.
						'motor' is used for connected motors in any of the outputs.</p>
					<p>It must be clear that not all of the types can be used with
						any port. For example a led is only an output, so if used with a
						input, for example IX it won't intialize. Also, if used to control
						as a word QW, it won't initialize either.</p></li>
				<li><p>specific</p>
					<p>As its name says, this third parameter has no general form,
						and can also be formed of other several parameters separated by
						points(as in case of the led). Depending of the second parameter,
						the allowed values for this one are different, and it will be seen
						in the follow section.</p></li>
			</ol></li>
	</ol>
<!--**********-->
	<h3>Specific Parameters</h3>

	<p>For each possible typeOfIO, the list of possible specific part
		of the parameters are presented, followed by the limitations and
		examples.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>led (output only):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>right.red</li>
				<li>right.green</li>
				<li>left.red</li>
				<li>left.green</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each specific is used to control each one of the four leds
				available. The orange led doesn't exist, but is the sum of red +
				green, so in order to turn on an orange light of the left for
				example, both the green and red of the left must be turned on.</p>
			<p>Limitation: 'led' must be used with QX and with the 'emb'
				port.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.led.right.red</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>button (input only):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>up</li>
				<li>down</li>
				<li>left</li>
				<li>right</li>
				<li>enter</li>
				<li>backspace</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Reads the buttons of the EV3.</p>
			<p>Limitation: 'button' must be used with IX and with the 'emb'
				port.</p>

			<p>Example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.button.enter</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>sensorw:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>[0-N] (input only)</li>
				<li>mode (input or output)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The sensorw is used with sensors that read a word value instead of a
				boolean and normally are more complex than regular touch sensors
				(boolean). Each sensor specifies how it retrieves the data, how many
				values and the format of it. Specifications of the supported sensors
				by the ev3dev are listed <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>Each one of the sensors' values is stored in a different file
				in the EV3. The specific [0-N] determines which file it is. For
				example the GYRO sensor can show the angle and the rotation speed.
				The values are store in value0 and value1 files, so to access just
				the rotation speed, the '1' specific must be used. The actual value
				must be checked in the link above.</p>

			<p>The 'mode' specific is used to change the mode of the sensor
				according to its specification. As an input, mode will retrieve the
				mode in which the sensor is working, and as output, the mode will be
				changed. The mode are mirrored using a 0 index according to the
				specification of the sensor.</p>

			<p>Limitation: sensorw cannot be used with boolean blocks (QX or
				IX). It must be used with an in[1-4] port, but is not restricted to
				input or output blocks when the specific "mode" is used.</p>

			<p>Limitation: the specific [0-N] can be used only as input, and
				the number shouldn't be greater than the allowed by the sensor in
				the mode that's working at the moment of initialization.</p>
			<p>Examples:</p>

			<p>
				Let's see an example of using the GYRO sensor specified <a
					target="_blank"
					href="http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/lego-ev3-gyro-sensor/">here</a>.
				The GYRO works in GYRO-ANG by default, showing only one value, then
				the only possible parameter is:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in1.sensorw.0 (IW)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>If a 1 instead of a 0 were used, the initialization would have
				failed.</p>
			<p>If the mode of the sensor wants to be retrieve, the "mode"
				specific should be used with the input IW.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in1.sensorw.mode (IW)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Because the GYRO sensor by default is in GYRO-ANG and GYRO-ANG
				is the first of the list according to the link above, the FB will
				read a 0 (0-index from the list in the link).</p>

			<p>If then the sensor's mode is changed using a QW with "mode"
				specific</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in1.sensorw.mode (QW)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>and writing a value 3 (0-index mode), the sensor's mode will
				change to GYRO-G&amp;A wich shows 2 values, angle and rotation
				speed. After changing the mode, two IW blocks with parameters</p>

			<ul>
				<li>in1.sensorw.0 (IW)</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>in1.sensorw.1 (IW)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>will retrieve the both values.</p>

			<p>ATTENTION!!! To get the rotation speed, the block with
				parameter "in1.sensorw.1" must be initialized AFTER the mode has
				been changed, because before changing the mode, the file for the
				rotation speed doesn't exist in the system and cannot be read.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>sensor (input only):</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[0-N]</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Used to control touch sensor (binary). sensor' specific is a
				subset of sensorw' specific. It doesn't allow mode, and even though
				the value is always stored in '0', the '0' specific must be used for
				two mainly reasons: 1. To have a standarized way of showing the
				parameters, and 2. to avoid problems in the future where a new
				sensor is stored in '1' instead of '0'.</p>

			<p>Limitations: 'sensor' must be used with QX and with an in[1-4]
				port.</p>

			<p>Example:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in2.sensor.0</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>motor</p>
			<ul>
				<li>enable (output boolean only)</li>
				<li>reset (output boolean only)</li>
				<li>stop (output word only)</li>
				<li>pwm (input word or output word only)</li>
				<li>position (input or output double word only)</li>
				<li>speed (input word only)</li>
				<li>rot (input word only)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The 'enable' controls the state of the motor accroding to the
				OUT input of QX. A TRUE value turns ON the motor and a FALSE value
				turns it OFF. It must be used with QX.</p>

			<p>The 'reset' zeroes the position, pwm and speed values, and
				turn off the motor with a TRUE value in OUT. A FALSE value in OUT
				has no effect. It must be used with QX</p>

			<p>The 'stop' specific must not be confused with stoping the
				motor, because it specifies the way the motor behaves when PWM is
				zero according to the value written to OUT. It must be used with QW
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>0: [coast]: Removes power from the motor. The motor will
					freely coast to a stop.</li>
				<li>1: [brake]: Removes power from the motor and creates a
					passive electrical load. This is usually done by shorting the motor
					terminals together. This load will absorb the energy from the
					rotation of the motors and cause the motor to stop more quickly
					than coasting.</li>

				<li>3: [hold]: Causes the motor to actively try to hold the
					current position. If an external force tries to turn the motor, the
					motor will "push back" to maintain its position.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The 'pwm' reads the current pwm when using with IW of the
				motor or writes the desired pwm for the motor when using with QW.</p>

			<p>The 'position' reads the current position of the motor. In how
				many steps a rotation is divided, can be read from using the 'rot'
				specific. It must be used with ID. The position can be written, wich
				sets the position to the desired value.</p>

			<p>The 'speed' reads the current speed in positions per second. It
				must be used with IW.</p>

			<p>The 'rot' reads the motor specication of how many steps are in
				one turn of the motor. This can be read from the specifications of
				the motor normally and it's not necessary to add the block in an
				application just to read this information. It must be used with IW.</p>

			<p>Limitations: Event though each specific has its limitation
				regarding the type of block to use with, the typeOfIO "motor" must
				be used with one of the outputs of the EV3 out[A-B]</p>

			<p>Examples:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>outB.motor.enable (QX)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><p>outB.motor.pwm (QW writes the desired pwm, IW reads
						the actual pwm)</p></li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><p>outB.motor.position (ID)</p></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 id="ev3_cheatsheet">I/O Cheatsheet</h2>

	<p>This section doesn't add any new information, but summarize
		which parameters and FB should be used with each I/O.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Touch sensor connected to an input port. It must be used with
				IX</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>in[X].sensor.[Y]</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>where X is the number of the input in the EV3 (1-4) and Y is
				the value number where to read from according to the sensor. Read
				the specification of the sensor to be sure. Start trying from 0 if
				no information is available.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>One of the 6 buttons of the EV3. It must be used with IX</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.button.[up | down | left | right | enter |
						backspace]</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Only one of the inputs can be selected for each IX.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>emb.led.[right | left].[red | green]</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>The orange led does not exist, but is the sum of green + red.</p>

			<p>Motor connected to an output port. The FB to use depends on

					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.enable</p></li>
					</ul>

				<li>
					<p>Reset the motor variables and stop. It must be used with QX.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.reset</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where X is the output capital letter of the EV3 (A-D, in
						uppercase). A TRUE value in OUT resets all of the motor parameter
						attributes to their default values. This will also have the effect
						of stopping the motor. A FALSE value doesn't have any effect.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Read current duty cycle (pwm) from a motor. It must be used
						with IW.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.pwm</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						The read value is between -100 and 100. It might seem confusing
						reading an input from an output but even though the signal is from
						an output, it is an input to the system.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Read the current speed of the motor. It must be used with
						IW.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.speed</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						It reads the velocity in steps per second. How many steps are in
						one turn of the motor can be read with the parameter "rot" (see
						next). If a motor has 360 steps in one turn and the speed is 720,
						then the speed is 2 rotations per second.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Read the number of steps in each turn. It must be used with
						IW.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.rot</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						This value is fixed in the motor and can be found in the
						specifications of the motor and it normally shouldn't be used in
						an application.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Read the current position of the motor. It must be used with
						ID.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.position</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						If the motor was in position 0 and the "rot" parameter returns
						360, then it makes 3 turns, the position will be 1080.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Write the position of a motor. It must be used with QD.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.position</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						Sets the current position to a specific value.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Write a desired duty cycle (pwm) for a motor. It must be
						used with QW.</p>

					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.pwm</p></li>
					</ul>

					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						The value range should be between -100 and 100.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Specify a desired behaviour when the pwm is set to 0. It
						must be used with QW.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>out[X].motor.stop</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Where X is the output letter of the EV3 (A-D, in uppercase).
						Possible values are 0, 1 and 2:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>0: [coast]: Removes power from the motor. The motor will
							freely coast to a stop.</li>
						<li>1: [brake]: Removes power from the motor and creates a
							passive electrical load. This is usually done by shorting the
							motor terminals together. This load will absorb the energy from
							the rotation of the motors and cause the motor to stop more
							quickly than coasting.</li>
						<li>3: [hold]: Causes the motor to actively try to hold the
							current position. If an external force tries to turn the motor,
							the motor will push back to maintain its position.</li>

					</ul>
					<p>where X is the number of the input in the EV3 (1-4) and Y is
